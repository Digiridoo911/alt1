# BOLG enlarger

The BOLG enlarger will show the Bow of the Last Guardian buff/stacks. The app can be resized. 

The app supports two modes: using the buff bar API (default) and an image search algorithm. The first option only supports small icons. The latter also supports medium and large icons, however it does have a higher CPU usage. You can switch between modes by left-clicking anywhere in the app.
