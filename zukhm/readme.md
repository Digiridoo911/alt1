# Zuk hardmode helper

Experimental app to aid with TzKal-Zuk waves, a challenge on Runescape.
The app is currently not maintained or updated.

The app shows an image that shows how to solve the wave, and the ability rotation is shown below. On wave completion, the app will automatically show the next wave solve. You can navigate through the waves by left or right-clicking on the image to go the next or previous wave, respectively.
