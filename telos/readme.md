# Telos Attack Tracker

The Telos attack tracker is an Alt1 app to help you fight Telos, an end-game boss in Runescape.

- The app will show the last attack, and the upcoming attack.
- The "time until freedom" bar shows the time until Telos is able to use the freedom ability again.
- The "time until change" bar shows the time until the beam changes on phase 1, 2, 3 and 5.
- The "time until vuln wears off" bar shows the time until vulnerability wears off. Currently does NOT support vulnerability bombs.
- The "time until insta kill" bar shows the time until the insta-kill mechanic occurs on phase 5. 
- The "Telos Helper" text will be replaced with an attack counter for phase 5, if enabled in the settings.

Finally, there is a settings menu to enable or disable the previous mentioned options. Under the performance section you can change the interval at which the screen is read. Recommended is to check atleast twice per tick (i.e. 300 ms interval), to make sure that the timers are accurate. A low interval causes a higher CPU usage.
The stepless timer setting allows you to switch between 0.1 second granularity (true) and 0.6 second granularity (false).

- Interface scaling needs to be at 100% (this is the default).
- It is recommended to turn timestamps on in the chat box to improve chatreader accuracy. This can be changed by ticking the box in Gameplay Settings > Chat & Social > Chat Customisation > Local timestamps in chat box.
